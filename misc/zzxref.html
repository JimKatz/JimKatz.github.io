</span><span class='cpp09'># Welcome to Hope's Peak Academy! Firstly, we'd like to explain the basic controls. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># You can use the left stick to adjust your aim. You can also tap the touch screen to place the reticle.
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># If you aim at an object you can interact with, you can press the X button or tap the screen... And presto! You'll investigate that object. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># Use the directional buttons or the L and R buttons to adjust your viewpoint. Why don't you try looking around the classroom?
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># Use the left stick to move through the hallway. Hold down the Circle button while moving to run.
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># Also, you can press the Triangle button to bring up a map. Press the Triangle button again to close the map. How convenient!
</span><span class='cpp00'>



</span>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<span class='cpp00'>






</span><span class='cpp09'># Aim at a student and press the X button to talk to them. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># Each conversation is important to the overall story, so keep track of how they go.
</span><span class='cpp00'>





</span>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<span class='cpp00'>






</span><span class='cpp09'># Okay, time for some more tutorial action!
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># You can press the Triangle button to observe the room you're in. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># Observing will display what people and objects you can interact with. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># Sorry for the late notice!
</span><span class='cpp00'>






</span>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<span class='cpp00'>






</span><span class='cpp09'># You now have access to the Handbook Menu. You can use this to check a variety of information as you play. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># Open the Handbook Menu by pressing the Square button. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># You can use this menu to check the School Regulations, and character info in the Report Card section.
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># At certain points, Map and Truth Bullets may not be available. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># You can also save and load game data under the System section.
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># Finally, press the SELECT button to review the Transcript. This records all pertinent info, so use this to review comments from everyone involved.
</span><span class='cpp00'>







</span>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<span class='cpp00'>






</span><span class='cpp02'>// Reactions are basically a small mechanic in which you can change a conversation's direction by pushing Triangle to select the 
// purple words in a sentence, then pressing X to continue the conversation. In practice however, Reactions don't affect the
// conversations that much because there's basically no reason not to React to every instance that they show up. In fact,
// sometimes you MUST React to something to progress the story.
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp02'>// They are used more heavily in the beginning of the game to demonstrate the feature, but most of what is said in a Reaction 
// conversation is stuff you could have learned even if you skip the Reaction. They're harmless enough, but I'm not a big fan of
// them. The writers could have accomplished what Reactions do by just writing the conversations a little better.
</span><span class='cpp00'>





</span>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<span class='cpp00'>






</span><span class='cpp09'># For anyone who just haaates walking around the school, we've got some good news! You can now teleport using the &quot;Map&quot;
# section of the Handbook Menu. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># It's as simple as opening the Map Menu and choosing where you want to go! However, you can only teleport to hallways and marked waypoints. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># Plus, you can't teleport to places you haven't been, or places that are blocked off. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># And depending on certain story moments, there will be times when you won't be able to teleport at all. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># Finally, try not to teleport inside any walls. There's a chance you could get lost. Forever. Well then...good luck, and have fun!
</span><span class='cpp00'>




</span>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<span class='cpp00'>









</span><span class='cpp09'># You're about to have your first experience with Free Time. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>



</span><span class='cpp09'># As you live out your school life here, you will be given free time at certain points. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># During your free time, you can spend time with your fellow classmates to deepen your friendships.
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># You can also give them presents, which can potentially give them an even better impression of you! 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># You can get these presents from the MonoMono Machine in the school store. Come by early and often!
</span><span class='cpp00'>



</span><span class='cpp09'># At certain points, you'll witness intimate events, and new info will be added to each person's report card. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># These events can also open up new skills, which will prove useful as everything plays out. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># We strongly encourage you to develop and deepen as many friendships as you can! 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># Also keep in mind that when you talk with a classmate time will pass... When you're finished, you will automatically return to your room.
</span><span class='cpp00'>




</span><span class='cpp09'># After a certain amount of time passes, your free time will come to an end and the story will progress. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># If you'd prefer not to engage in free time, you can always choose to simply go to sleep to skip it. 
</span><span class='cpp00'>
</span><span class='cpp09'># We wouldn't recommend this approach, but if you absolutely MUST press forward with the story, then...
</span><span class='cpp00'>





</span><span class='cpp09'># Anyways, why don't you try it out by spending some time with Miss Sayaka Maizono? She's the ideal partner to begin with, don't you think?
</span><span class='cpp00'>
