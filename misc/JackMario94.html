<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:26px;"><b>If you plan to mod any wii games, look out for a user named &quot;</b></span></font><span style="font-size:26px;"><strong style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: center;">JackMario94&quot;. He is known to steal textures from released modpacks, change a few textures, and reupload it in his own modpack that he claims he made. He once stole a Cave Story MenuSingle that I made for Mario Kart Wii and put it in one of his modpacks, he even disabled commenting on the video because he knew he would be called out. Be extra careful when modding any of the following games, as he follows them all to look for new content to steal: Wii Sports, Wii Sports Resort, Wii Play, Wii Party, Wii Music, and Wii Fit Plus</strong></span></p>
